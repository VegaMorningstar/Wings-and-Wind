/**
 * "How this was built": a short, illustrated account of the loading screen,

 * The main thread of the document is design language, the reasoning behind

 * Implementation lives in <Detail> blocks, which do not mount their contents
 * until opened, so the reader chooses the depth and pays only for what they

                The screen you just cleared is a single canvas. This is the short version of how it
                was designed: why the wait offers you something to do rather than something to
                watch, how the animal was drawn and the field arranged, how the motion was tuned,
                and how the exit was choreographed to be the part you remember.

              A loading screen is an apology. Something is not ready, and the person in front of you
              has to sit with that. There are only three honest things you can offer them in
              exchange: you can tell them how long it will take, you can take their attention
              somewhere else, or you can give them something to do.

              Those are a progress bar, an animation, and a toy. This is the third, and the choice
              writes the rest of the brief. A toy has to answer instantly, reward poking at it, and
              above all <Em>let the person be the one who ends it</Em>. The moment someone dismisses
              the screen themselves, the wait stops being something done to them.

              That last claim is a design judgement, not a measured result, and it is worth saying
              which it is. What the evidence supports is the narrower point in section 2.

              The useful research here predates the web. Maister&apos;s propositions on queue
              psychology <Cite k="maister" /> hold that occupied time feels shorter than unoccupied
              time, that uncertain waits feel longer than known ones, and that unexplained waits feel
              longer than explained ones. Work on tolerable waiting in web interfaces{' '}
              <Cite k="nah" /> reaches compatible conclusions about how fast patience runs out.
            </P>
            <P>Plate 1 is that first proposition, run on you. Both waits are exactly six seconds.</P>

            <WaitDemo />

            <P>
              Notice what the occupied wait is not doing. It is not entertaining you and it is not
              informing you. It is giving your attention somewhere to go that answers back. That
              loop is the entire mechanism, and it matters more than the polish on either side of
              it.
            </P>

              It also happens to be an excellent subject. Three features survive being drawn at a

              looking rigid. It covers beautifully. It also builds a triangular lattice, and the

              continuation <Cite k={['wertheimer', 'glass']} />. Switch the plate to Half-step, turn

              There is no blur anywhere in the stack. Blur costs a pass per frame, and at this scale

              impression. Push the tone separation too far and the back layer stops reading as a

              A wingbeat has one requirement everything else follows from: the body must stay put
              while the wings move. Scale the whole insect and you have not animated a flap, you have
              animated a squash. So the wings and the body are two separate sprites with two separate
              transforms.

            <P>
              The rest is small lies that help. The sprite keeps 7 percent of its width at full fold
              rather than collapsing, so a closed butterfly still has an edge. The wings gain 12
              percent height as they close, because a folding membrane bunches. They rise slightly.
              The whole thing loses 16 percent opacity when shut, because a closed wing presents less
              surface to the light. Each is too subtle to notice alone. Remove them all and the flap
              goes flat.

              The four lanes cover the same distance in the same time and read as four different
              events. Linear reads as machinery, because nothing with mass accelerates instantly.
              Ease out is the shape of arriving. The release uses cubic ease in, because something
              leaving under its own power starts slowly and gains on you. Get it backwards and the
              swarm looks like it is being sucked upward by something off-screen.

              If a motion feels mechanical the fault is almost never the duration. It is that

              The naive implementation is a radial delay: further from the click means later
              departure. It works, and it reads as a wipe, because a smooth gradient of delays
              produces a smooth boundary.
            </P>

            <ReleaseDemo />

            <H3>Two things are happening, not one</H3>
            <P>
              Under the cursor, a fingertip has touched a butterfly. That is contact, and contact
              travels <Em>downward</Em> through the stack: front layer, then the one beneath, then
              the one beneath that. Everywhere else nothing has been touched. What spreads is alarm,
              passed neighbour to neighbour, and a panicking butterfly does not care which layer its
              panicking neighbour is in.
            </P>
            <P>
              So the release is two phases with different logic, and switching the contact phase off
              in the plate makes the whole thing flatter: it stops saying anything about what a
              fingertip is.
            </P>

            <H3>Quantise the distance</H3>
            <P>
              Distance is floored into rings about one wingspan wide rather than used continuously.
              That single decision turns a wipe into a wave: the field clears one discrete shell at a
              time, and shells are legible in a way gradients are not. The first rings are spaced
              four times further apart than the later ones, because the opening is the part worth
              watching and at full cadence it is over before the eye can separate it.
            </P>
            <P>
              Some butterflies hesitate, weighted by distance from the click, which follows from the
              model: near the click the alarm is contact and everyone goes at once, further out it is
              second-hand and second-hand panic is uneven.
            </P>

            <H3>Wind up from each departure, not from the click</H3>

            <TimelineDemo />

            <P>
              There is a real pause between the contact phase and the outward wave. On paper that is
              a stall, and it does not read as one, because the wind-up for each butterfly is
              measured backwards from its own launch rather than forwards from the click.
            </P>
            <P>
              Every butterfly knows when it is leaving, so it can start stirring 1.5 seconds before
              and beating hard 0.6 seconds before. The agitation inherits the ordering of the
              departure for free and rolls outward exactly as the clearing does. There is always a
              wide band of stirring ahead of a narrow band of hard beating, ahead of the front
              itself. The gap is full of tension rather than empty.
            </P>

            <H3>Overlap the ending</H3>
            <P>
              The page underneath does not wait for the last butterfly. The handoff fires when the
              final departing butterfly is about two thirds through its flight, so the content
              arrives through a thinning swarm rather than after an empty beat. Sequential handoffs
              feel slow even when they are fast, because the eye notices the seam.
            </P>
            <P>
              And a press during the release means the field has been seen. Rather than cutting, the
              clock driving the whole sequence speeds up until what remains fits in about four tenths
              of a second, so you still watch it happen, just hurried. Deriving that rate from what is
              actually left means the wait after a skip is the same wherever you press it.
            </P>

            <Note>
              A transition is a story with an actor in it, not a curve applied to opacity. Decide what
              is physically happening and to whom, and most of the timings derive themselves.

                Ground, three fields back to front with the front layer&apos;s shadows just before
                it, the cursor glow, then the vignette. Switching shadows to every layer costs
                measurably more for a difference you cannot see, which is why only the front layer
                casts one.
              </P>
              <P>
                The loop keeps two clocks. One drives per-butterfly integration and is clamped hard,
                because a large step makes it unstable. The other carries the release schedule and is
                clamped loosely, because it has to track the wall clock: an earlier version shared a
                single clamp, and any device that could not hold twenty frames a second then took
                proportionally <Em>longer</Em> to clear the field, which is precisely backwards for a
                loading screen.
              </P>
              <Note kind="watch">
                Any constant expressed as a fraction per frame is a frame rate assumption in
                disguise. The skip wind-up had the same fault: an ease of 0.34 per frame takes the
                same eight frames at any refresh rate, which is a fifth of a second at 60fps and most
                of a second at 10.

                Fill cost scales with the square of the device pixel ratio, so it is capped. The CSS
                pixel is defined against a reference pixel rather than a hardware one{' '}
                <Cite k="cssunits" />, which is why a 55 pixel wingspan is about the same physical

                It was not always true. For most of this build the field ignored the preference,
                and the honest reason it does not any more is that the field was packaged to be
                dropped into other people&apos;s pages. Shipping that omission once is a bug.
                Shipping it as a component for other people to install is a bug with a
